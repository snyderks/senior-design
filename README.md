## Abstract

Lupe is a convolutional neural network model designed to determine, in real-time, whether a person is lifting an object and if they are at increased risk of injuring themselves as a result. It uses accelerometer and gyroscope sensors placed in various locations of the body and was able to achieve ~90% accuracy as both a risk classifier and as a lift detector.

## Source Code Availability

Source code for the model itself is freely available upon request under a [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). Source data is *not* freely available, however, due to it not being approved for public release by the subjects and containing potentially personally-identifying information. Please send a request for the source data to the email for Kristian Snyder above, which will be evaluated and approved on a case-by-case basis (typically only for researchers and faculty).
