# Self Assessment

During this semester, while a majority of my progress centered on planning my various tasks and milestones for the spring semester, I also made progress on the project itself. As this is an existing research project, I had the challenge of adapting it and carving out portions that could fit into the semester of planning and the semester of execution time. This was especially interesting because of my having a collaborator on the project that will continue the efforts after my graduation. However, I believe that, overall, I completed this planning well albeit with some missteps in specificity and timelines. Therefore, alterations (as expected!) will be required as I progress in the spring.

## Design Diagrams

I believe this is where I most succeeded in my efforts this semester. Producing my design diagrams helped significantly with understanding both the data flow of my existing solution and where I could make refinements to the process. These may need updates given time, especially as I add the ability to save off models and make adjustments to the individual layers in the model, but the high-level diagram I expect to stay the same.

## Tasks and Timeline

These are where I had the most challenge adapting a research project to a product-based approach. However, I realized that, in this process, I am just as much of a product as the end users and NIOSH as a collaborator. Therefore, several of the tasks are designed to increase my own speed of development so that I can advance the performance of the model more quickly. This is in recognition of the project mostly requiring tuning, refinement, and theoretical development instead of actual data manipulation and pipeline construction, tasks typical to a product-based approach.

Developing the timeline was the weakest facet of the semester. Predicting development time is difficult in the best of situations; however, determining how long research-centric tasks will take without confidence in the process itself is even more difficult. I made an effort to give rough estimates but believe I needed to develop something similar to a dependency chart and refine the timeline based on this to better its accuracy.

## Project Progress

Progress on the stated milestones both exceeded and was lower than expectations. Development of structural enhancements designed to assist in model development were completed sooner than expected, which will help even more as the model is refined. However, model development itself is nearly impossible to measure in terms of progress because of difficulties in determining how close to the next milestone of accuracy I am.

Due to these difficulties in measuring model progress, I will be working early spring semester in determining how to better measure this progress and estimate how close I am to a new breakthrough as well as more quickly estimating when a model strategy is stalling out.

## Conclusion

Several portions of this semester were extremely helpful in refining my development process and explicitly defining the software and data models of the project. Areas around tasks and milestones were helpful, but missed their potential due to the nebulous and twisting paths involved in reaching the overall goal, mostly due to lack of precedent in the area. Therefore, I believe I excelled in some areas but felt lacking in others, so next semester will be about focusing on these missed opportunities and pulling my weaknesses up.
